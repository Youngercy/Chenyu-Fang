I am currently a PhD candidate at the Technical University of Munich, specializing in Big Geospatial Data Management under the supervision of Prof. Martin Werner. In 2023, I had the opportunity to be a Visiting Scholar at the University of Cambridge, where I worked at the Lab of Interdisciplinary Spatial Analysis under the guidance of Prof. Elisabete A. Silva. I hold a Master's degree from Peking University and a BSc in Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry from Wuhan University, obtained in 2015.  Prior to my doctoral studies, I spent two years at the China Academic Urban Planning & Design Institute, focusing on urban planning and spatial analysis.

My research interests are deeply rooted in computational science, geoAI, urban informatics, social sensing, and large language models (LLMs). My aim is to apply cutting-edge artificial intelligence and big data technologies to fields including social sciences, urban studies, and natural ecology. Through my work, I seek to uncover the dynamic interactions between people, nature, and society in the modern era.

title: Individual Behavior, Built Environment, and Sustainable Development

summary: |-
  **Research Question:**
  This research investigates how individual behaviors interact with the built environment to influence sustainable development. The key questions addressed are: How do various elements of the built environment, such as multimodal transport systems and urban land use, impact individual daily activities? Additionally, how can urban planning and design enhance sustainability by influencing these behaviors?

  **My Work:**
  My research focuses on examining the intricate relationships between individual behavior patterns and their environmental contexts, emphasizing sustainable urban development. Through detailed analyses of multimodal transportation systems, urban land use intensity, and green space accessibility, I aim to propose strategies that not only enhance the efficiency and equity of urban systems but also foster environmental sustainability. My work leverages large-scale data sets, including mobile phone signaling data and geospatial information, to provide empirical insights into how built environments shape and are shaped by individual and collective behaviors

  **Research Method:**
  - **Data-Driven Analysis of Multimodal Transportation:** Utilizing mobile phone location data and bike-sharing trip records, I assess the effectiveness of multimodal transport systems in improving urban accessibility and sustainability. This method helps in understanding the role of bike-sharing in complementing public transit systems, particularly focusing on its efficiency and equity impacts.

  - **Quasi-Experimental Design:** Employing quasi-experimental designs to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on travel behaviors among older adults in Shenzhen, utilizing big data from mobile phones to assess changes over time and across different urban densities and land uses.

  - **Sustainable Urban Land Use Analysis:** Applying modifications to traditional land intensive use evaluations to explore the temporal and spatial characteristics of urban land use and its sustainability factors. This includes using models like the DPCSIR framework and econometric methods to understand how land use influences economic, social, and environmental outcomes.

  - **Evaluation of City Inequality:** Analyzing the accessibility and equity of urban parks using the TB-i2SFCA model and SHAP values. This method evaluates how well different urban and peri-urban areas are served by green spaces, focusing on equity across various demographic groups.

  -  **Behavioral Impact Assessment:** Investigating the changing dynamics of online and offline shopping behaviors and their relationship with travel patterns before and after significant disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis helps to understand how external shocks affect individual behavior and urban mobility.

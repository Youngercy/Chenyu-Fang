abstract: Although many studies have examined the associations between e-shopping and activity/travel behaviors, few have compared the changing relationships under the COVID-19 context. In this study, using an individual-level mobile phone signaling data set with application usage data, we develop a two-group structural equation model (SEM) to compare the endogenous associations between residents’ online and offline shopping behaviors along with their exogenous linkages with socioeconomic and built environments before and after the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen, China. The results demonstrate a sharp reduction of over 90% and 33% in offline and online shopping, respectively, during the pandemic. More interestingly, we found that the relationship between offline shopping time and online shopping duration changes from substitution to complementarity, probably because of the mobility restriction intervention and shortage of products. The associations between offline shopping time and travel time and distance remain consistent, with significant changes in magnitude but not in the signs of the coefficients. In addition, men and young individuals living in dense neighborhoods with high levels of walkability, street connectivity, and accessibility to regional shopping facilities may better moderate the impact of COVID-19. These findings can help policymakers better understand the impact of disruptive public health crises on people’s online/offline shopping and travel arrangements, for developing place- and group- specific pandemic prevention policies.

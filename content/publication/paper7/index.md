abstract: This study investigates spatial structure of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) at multiple scales by China telecom mobile signaling data in 2018. We quantify communities detected on a city, district, and sub-district scale by improved Louvain algorithm, analyze their roles and positions by degree centrality, and then examine the information exchange of brokers via improved brokerage analysis. The results show that multi-scale studies can reveal more hidden information. By dividing into 3 clusters at the city scale, the PRD has formed three urban agglomerations in line with the policy:Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing, Zhuhai-Zhongshan-Jiangmen, and Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou; 11 clusters at the district scales, which show different network structures and characteristics depending on the status of the cities they belong to, such as the sleeping city effect in Foshan; and 45 clusters at the street scale, we found more clusters and centers influenced by geographical proximity effects and traffic. We find more clusters and centers under the influence of geographical proximity and traffic. In addition, the administrative boundary effect in the PRD region is less restrictive to commuting behavior in general, but the division of communities at different scales is affected by administrative boundaries to different degrees, and the shielding effect of municipal administrative barriers is higher than that of district administrative barriers. The multi-scale community findings provide a reference and basis for the regional governance of the PRD and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay at different administrative levels.

abstract: The basis of urban studies is to ﬁnd a practical way to deﬁne urban areas. Traditional administrative boundaries and statistical data cannot express the rapid changes in urban morphology, while remote sensing data lacking labels are prone to the erroneous delineation of urban boundaries even with the advantages of large scale and high temporal resolution. This study thus uses feature-engineering and a combination of density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm (DBSCAN) to deﬁne a data-driven urban area in Bavaria State, Germany based on the Open Street Map data. First, we ﬁlter the features in the OSM with feature engineering to obtain ﬁve target POI types characterizing urban areas. Then we used the DBSCAN algorithm, which ignores the inﬂuence of urban morphology and noise on the selected OSM data, to generate the urban area of Bavaria, Germany. The results show that the two hyperparameters of DBSCAN ( ε and minPts) inﬂuence the extent of data-driven urban areas at diﬀerent scales. The rise in ε is with the phenomenon that large cities are annexing small towns or several small towns clustered together, and the direction and manner of development of urban areas are inﬂuenced by geographical conditions. And the rise in minPts leads to fewer urban clusters, smaller urban areas, and more prominent urban centers. This study ﬁnally discusses the identiﬁcation of data-driven cities and the implication for urban and spatial planning and strategies.
